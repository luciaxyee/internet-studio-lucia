	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<h2>Reading Material Insights</h2>
	  <p>I learned that in the Web 1.0 era, people had to pay per page viewed; in the Web 2.0 era, it became social; and in the Web 3.0 era,
	  data was understood together conceptually and in context. Another interesting takeaway is that social media went from the individual 
	  to global connections, to the focus on the individual again. I also didn't know how much these computer languages change, and third-party
	  adapt to keep up with current technology and its ongoing advancements.</p>
	<h2>Semester Project</h2>
      <p>For my Semester Project, I want to make a website that shows the functionality of different art products and brands.</p>
