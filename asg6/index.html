	<h1>SIX THINKING HATS</h1>

	<h2 class="white">White Hat</h2>
		<p class="wp">The white hat presents the facts of a situation and doesn’t consider any factors other than what is true and can be supported by other sources of information. It brings in facts, the numbers, and the raw data that are not influenced by feelings or emotions. It asks questions, but it doesn’t have the bias of emotions. It finds the logistical gaps in information through question asking and realistic viewpoints. It gives a very logical and statistical standpoint. It’s very important for gathering information and acknowledging the facts of external and internal factors.</p>
	<h2 class="red">Red Hat</h2>
		<p class="rp">This hat is based on emotions and feelings of different perspectives on a situation. It’s more about the reaction to a specific situation. The white hat gives a good basis for the red hat ot react to. There doesn’t need to be a logical explanation for the feeling; it’s just important that it’s there. The feelings can be positive or negative, and in most situations, both are beneficial to consider in a situation. This allows for very human thoughts that are more about preference, but can help give empathy to the user.</p>
	<h2 class="black">Black Hat</h2>
		<p class="bkp">The black hat allows the thinker to bring up potential issues based on what is already there, good or bad. It’s the criticism hat that also offers a good amount of caution, caution that protects both the creator and the user. This protects the creator from trying to achieve the unrealistic, and it protects the user by giving them a realistic expectation and product. This hat is not emotional, but rather logical, like the white hat. It takes information from both the white and red hats and finds a happy medium between both them. This looks at the possible bad sides of a situation, and keeps the creator from only thinking of the positive (like an unrealistic dreamer).</p>
	<h2 class="yellow">Yellow Hat</h2>
		<p class="yp">This hat is also logical, but it’s the latter, being a positive hat. It allows the thinker to acknowledge what did work and what is good to keep. It finds worth in looking forward to better results in something that was already run, but now there are better results because there are more supports or interactions than before. It acknowledges the benefits and keeps the things that work really well. This is the supportive, yet logical, thinker.</p>
	<h2 class="green">Green Hat</h2>
		<p class="gp">This is the hat that offers unique and outside-of-the-box possibilities to a situation. This gives offers structural changes to an idea, sometimes turning it on its head for the sake of being interesting and different from before. This hat is the one that sparks changes because the way this thinker thinks is different from how the situation already is. This is the hat that often has a more zoomed-out perspective from the rest and isn’t fearful to explore different possibilities within a situation. This hat also bounces off of the black hat’s perspectives and points. It offers solutions and creative solutions.</p>
	<h2 class="blue">Blue Hat</h2>
		<p class="bp">This is the manager hat. This hat overlooks all of the thoughts and ideas that are being bounced around. It facilitates conversation and recognizes when there’s a lack of a certain perspective or view. It casts out a specific view and guides the conversation to point back to the original purpose of the situation. It finds a balance between all of the different ideas and is able to categorize the different thoughts so that the weight of each hat is considered in striving towards a goal.</p>

	<h3 class="summary">SUMMARY</h3>

		<p class="sp">The perspective that I had on my project changed after considering the different hats because it helped me see a lot from the user’s views rather than my own. Whenever I thought of the design process, I didn’t consider the different perspectives in such specificity. I think that this is a really good way to break down the different ways of thinking in design. I think that all of these things fall under the beginning stages of designing, which makes it even more significant. This has changed my view on my project to research the facts of the art supply industry better and to organize gathered information better so that it’s easy to comprehend and use for my project. The white hat is where I’m most lacking, and the hat I’m the most prominent in is the green hat.</p>
