    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>I really like to spend time using watercolor, acrylics, and colored pencils. I also spend time in digital art with a painterly style. I love to make things for people and things that are meaningful to my beliefs and meaningful to other people. I also like to play guitar on the side, and I also like to learn more about other people and hear their stories, experiences, and what's currently going on in their lives. My goal is to become a children's book illustrator, but honestly anything that allows me to use some form of artistic-eye or ability sounds really fun!</p>
