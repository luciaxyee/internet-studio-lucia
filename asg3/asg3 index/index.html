      <h2>Do's and Don'ts of Web Design</h1>
        <p><a href = "https://auth.band.us/login?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fband.us"> In this website</a>, the clickable “keep me logged in” button is not obvious because it’s small and in a light grey color.</p>
      <h2>Better User Expereince through Storytelling</h1>
        <p>Framing my project can help organize and refine my ideas because it helps define why this project is significant to me, which helps define the main purpose. This puts more value on the website and its purpose because it’s more meaningful when there’s a reason behind it, and it doesn’t just a function. It brings clarity to the website's existence and vision when it’s connected to a group of people. It also brings understanding to other companies that are looking into why the website is there. In thinking of all of these things, it helps refine the idea in the process of creating a story.</p>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
        <p>Some good ways to make typography pop on a page is to increase the size and put it in bold, to put it in a style different from the body, and to have a good amount of spacing between the body and the title. Here is my <a href = "https://simplychocolatecph.com/">example</a> of a good website with a good typography.
    <h1>Creative Brief</h1>
          <p>The problem is that people are unsure of how art products work before they buy them, like paints, brushes, markers, and colored pencils. They don’t know the exact color they’re getting, how the brush paints, or the overlap of a marker. Another problem is that people who get art supplies don’t know how the quality or pigments change over time. The Audience is people who use art supplies, ranging from beginners to professionals. The competition is companies who will try to display their brand at its best performance. The key message is to inform the viewers of how each brand works depending on their different wants and needs. It is also to show how the materials change, or stay consistent over time. The call to action is to add or suggest any missing or new brands that need to keep the website up to date and useful towards the user’s changing needs. Another call to action is to vote on their favorite product based on the different categories of tools. The success is based on how many people view and vote/comment on the different products, and if there is a want for the website to be updated.</p>
