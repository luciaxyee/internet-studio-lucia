	<h2>About Shane and Shane</h2>
	  <p>Shane and Shane is a Texas based worship band that also sings with the Worship Initiative. The band consists of Shane Barnard who sings and plays guitar with the band and Shane Everett who also sings for the band. Their manager is also thier drummer named Joey Parish. They both went to college at A&M and from there they've been releasing albums and singles ever since with a year break in 2010. A large portion of albums they've done include key words like Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs. They've done a lot of covers of old hymns to make them modern as well as a lot of their own songs that really bring a lot of emotion and personal background in it. They've also turned Psalms, poems from the Bible, into songs that are soothing and strong in style and spirit.</p>

    <h2>Why Shane and Shane is My Favorite Band</h2>
      <p>Shane and Shane is my favorite band because they wrote my favorite song, of which helped me in a difficult time and it was very uplifing and encouranging. This is my favorite band because they take direct quotes from the Bible and make them into songs with moving melodies that help memorize the lyrics. I like this band because they write songs based on how they've been impacted by the same God that I believe in and are vulnerable behind the meanings of thier songs. I like this band because the melodies are catchy and because my beliefs strongly align with their lyrics.</p>
