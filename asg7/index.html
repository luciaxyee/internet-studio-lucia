    	<h2>Baymax for Vice President</h2>
    		<p>Baymax would be a good side authority because he works well with Hiro and he challenges him with the harder aspects of a situation that he doesn't really think about when he's caught up in the emotional aspect of things. Dispite his automated voice he's very caring and friendly with those who interact with him. Being a robot, he's also very selfless and devoted to caring for those around him, especially Hiro. He's a good friend that takes care of Hiro when he's not doing too great himself.</p>
