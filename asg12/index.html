I also liked the curiosity of the film as a whole.</p>

    	<h1>8. Frozen</h1>
    	<img src="images/frozen.jpg">
    	<p>I liked this movie mainly because of its plot and the reflection that was on the ice. I thought it was made really well and I cried during the plot.

    	<p>I liked this movie because I thought it was really funny and it was also a really pretty movie to watch because it takes you through Singapore, and also everything looks really nice because they're really rich. I also liked the point they were making, not only that wealth isn't everything, but it's important to break bad generational cycles.</p>
