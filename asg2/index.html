  <h2>Structured Content verses Semantic HTML</h2>
    <p>Structured content is organization for humans to understand and semantic html is structure for the computer to understand. The information is more directly abvalible by machines, where in semantic html the search engine looks for the lower hierarchical information (ex. h3, h4, etc.) below the higher informational topic (in higher headers ex. h1, h2) it categorizes it. In structured content the machine looks more at the direct informaion and in semantic html it looks more at the coding structure.</p>
  <h2>Working together</h2>
  	<p>They work together because structured content provides something for the seach engine to read, while the semantic allows the user to understand what the search engine/found wesite gives.</p>
  <h2>Importance</h2>
    <p>It's important to have structured data so that the computer knows what the site is about and is able to give the site as a suggestion when the user searches relating/correlating key words, and it's important to have semantic data so that when the user recieves the data they're able to understand the data given to them, and so that it's more structed in a way that makes the information more digestable.</p>

    <h2>Banishing Your Inner Critic</h2>
      <p>The most successful for me to be to use it as a form to push myself and improve what I'm working on the "Learn from the Master". This is the most successful for me because it makes me think of other possibilites that can sometimes be better and to focus on details that make the the whole special and unique. The one of seeking the truth is also part of it because at a certain point it's important to recognize when to complete a piece.</p>
    <h2>Hyperbolic</h2>
      <p>Hyperbolic discounting is when you want to choose the things that give us instant gratification over goals for the future by double-booking yourself in the future (Procrastination). One of the methods is to accept the "now you" which I think is the best strategy for me because it helps consider what I want to do in the moment and not what I will, or have the possibility of not doing, in the future.</p>
    <h2>Networks</h2>
      <p>I have power in Networking power, because I can invite different people/things in my content that I decide. I have power in network power because I'm in control of the code's structure, like images and hyperlinks. I do not have power in networked power because I can not control the exposure of my link through the hosted platforms, meaning that they are the ones who control it, as well as the people interating with it. I do not have power in network-making power because I do not control the overarching platform/network that it is on.</p>
