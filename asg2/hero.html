  <h1>The Wild Robot: The Heart of Steel</h1>
  <h2>The Robot that Learned Empathy</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The Wild Robot is a part of a film that is adapted from the book entitled The Wild Robot, by Peter Brown. The movie was released in 2024, following the book's release in 2016. The visuals of this movie are very painterly and embrace the imperfect stroke marks of traditional materials and techniques that convey the softness of the natural world. The style of the Wild Robot is more rigid, but as she continues to move through the world, moss starts to grow on her as her character does. This character becomes a soft and understanding character from a rigid and closed minded character, which makes the character lovable because of the drastic change for good, for understanding emotions and others.</p>
  
  <h3>Journey</h3>
    <p>The Wild Robot is washed up upon the shore of a fully natural island that has no human civilization.

After moments of inner challenges of whether or not she wants to commit to this newly hatched chick, she decides to become its mother and help the chick to migrate even if it means overriding her inner truths. In the end, she ends up growing a strong sense of emotion towards those in the forest and a love towards the chick. Challenges present themselves and sheâ€™s able to care for the animals in the forest because of her new found understanding of how to care for them and save the forest. Her presence is overall, not good for the forest because of the people trying to find her so she ends up leaving, but before that she reunites with the chick.</p>
