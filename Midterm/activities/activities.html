	<h1>Exploring the Truffula Forest</h1>
		<h2>Climb the Truffula Trees and Knit mittens</h2>
		    <img src="images/lorax_03.jpg" class="image">
			<p>Join us for an outdoor adventure in the magical forest of the Truffula trees, for an experience that will allow you to experience the amazing texture of the tree’s tufts. Have fun climbing the trees and enjoying the view while being surrounded by the softness and comfortablility of the softness of the tree. Upon special request, ask for an experienced knitter who will teach and guide you in creating a soft creation of your own to keep your hands warm during the winter! In this experience, you will be allowed to take a small amount of the Truffula tree’s tuft to knit mittens of your own and to keep a part of this magical experience with you in a practical way! Hopefully, this experience and its keepsake will remind you to be mindful of nature’s beauty and fragility.</p>
		<h2>Swimming and Rowing with the Humming-Fish</h2>
			<img src="images/fish.jpg" class="image">
			<p>Come jump into a time of fun, whether you love to swim or you love to float along the river in a boat, this is the most relaxing and the most breathtaking experience in a river you will ever have. Not only will you be able to spend time in the perfectly cooling waters of the river, but you’ll get to enjoy the view of the colorful Truffula trees!! If you’re lucky, you might even see some of the humming-fish swimming along in the river alongside you or your boat! Even if you don’t get to see the humming-fish, there’s a likely chance that you’ll be able to hear their melodic tunes. This experience is here to help you slow down and pay attention to the small beauties that nature has to offer, whether in the beautiful colors around you, or through the singing melodies of the humming-fish.</p>
		<h2>Visit the Thneed Factory</h2>
		    <img src="images/factory.jpg" class="image">
			<p>Although the Thneed Factory was the reason for the previous deforestation of the Truffula Trees, it is still very significant to remember the errors of our actions and to reflect on how we are impacting life outside humanity today. Join us for a tour of the factory, how it works, and the motives of its purpose. It provides a quiet space to reflect and to think about how we are so fortunate to now have a regrown forest that we can now share with you! We strongly encourage visitors to come here for the experience and also for the history of our beloved forest. As the factory grew more and more as the trees slowly started to fade away. The purpose of this experience is for you to consider your own factories, even if they’re small right now.</p>
