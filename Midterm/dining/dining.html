		<h2>Grammy Norma’s Cafe</h2>
			<img src="images/cafe.jpg" class="image">
			<p>We invite you to a warm and welcoming environment into Grammy Norma’s Cafe in the house she grew up in. Her family decided to move out, so she turned their own house into a cafe and now hosts all who visit to tell them stories of Thneedville and also of the Truffula Forest, both from the past and the now. Her specialty is freshly baked pies from the fruit of the truffula trees. She also serves some of the foods that she enjoyed most before the synthetic foods came, like salads, a variety of candied fruits, and fried fish sticks. This cafe is a very relaxing space to relax and enjoy some treats or a hearty meal. The atmosphere is very friendly and a good place to get some work done, or just to hang out with a good friend.</p>
		<h2>The Truffula Fruit Stand</h2>
			<img src="images/stand.jpeg" class="image">
			<p>If meat isn’t your thing, no problem! Come visit the outdoor fruit stand in the Truffla Forest, where they provide plenty of meat alternatives, as well as sweet treats. Enjoy a variety of choices varying from the most complex, where sweet is turned savory: Truffula Burgers, Truffula skewers, and Truffula Tacos, to the fruit in its simplest form: Candied Truffula Fruit, Truffula Jam on Toast, or just the fruit itself! Come inside to enjoy the view of the forest from above, or eat outside and enjoy the cool breeze of the forest and the sound of the tree tufts rustling.</p>
		<h2>Thneedville’s Jelly</h2>
		    <img src="images/jello.jpg" class="image">
			<p>Try a part of Thneedville’s history in a slice of jello! Before the forest grew back, they relied on synthetic jello that is made without anything natural. It might taste a little strange, but it’s definitely an experience to not forget! Come visit Audrey’s house, where she offers a side-by-side comparison of the synthetic jello that was once the only thing that was served and some jello that she made from all-natural ingredients. Here, you can be the judge of which one you like better, and you can even take some to go to share with your loved ones. This restaurant is a great place to culturally experience Thneedville and to see how the ingredients available change how the food tastes. The environment of this restaurant is very artistic and beautiful, and it’s a fun place to go and spark conversation.</p>
