		<h2>Design Rationale</h2>
			<p>I chose cursive for the header font to give it a whimsical feel. I chose it because it matches the twirling and twisting tufts of the trees, and it gives it a fluid feel. I chose a sans-serif font for the body because I wanted it to feel very friendly and youthful. Serif fonts give a very professional feel, so I chose a sans-serif font because I wanted it to feel almost child-like. I also chose this font for the body because it feels almost bubbly while also being structured and easy to read. I made the first header (h1) the largest header across all of the pages because it gives a general summary of what the page is about and why the reader should read the page. I made the subheaders (h2) smaller than the first class of headers, but also still much larger than the paragraph text, so that information is broken up and more digestible. I made the paragraph font about half the size of the header so it’s not overwhelming but still readable. I added a white haze behind the page’s content to match the transparency of the clouds in the scene. I also put it there for better readability. I chose a combination of orange, pink, and yellow for the text and buttons to accent the text, which is the most important content on the page.</p>
			<p>I made the background light blue with small and simple clouds to give the viewer a relaxed atmosphere and to match the weather of the Truffula Forest. I chose a picture of the overall scene of rolling hills of Truffula Trees to give the viewer a very good idea of what the area looks like. On the activities page, I chose a picture of The Lorax climbing the tree to give it an inviting feel, a picture of the Humming-Fish to show what the fish looks like, and a picture of the factory to give the viewer an idea of what it looks like. For the dining options, I chose pictures that best depicted what each of the dining spots looks like and what the jello looks like for the last option. I chose a picture of the trees for the design statement because I was inspired by the trees. I chose a picture with the bears for the contact page to give it a welcoming feel. I placed the buttons for navigation at the top and the contact buttons at the bottom to provide continuity in relation to other sites. I rounded the corners of the buttons to help it fit the theme of friendliness and to give them a whimsical feel. I made the navigation buttons turn a darker color to give them more emphasis. For the contact buttons, I made them change to orange when you hover, and yellow when you click to display all of the colors of the trees. I made it yellow when the user clicks so that they know that they’re clicking on it, and to make it more interesting.</p>
