	<h1>Domain Names</h1>
		<h2>Top Three</h2>
			<h3 class="domain">ArtKit.com</h3>
			<h3 class="domain">ArtistsDesk.com</h3>
			<h3 class="domain">CanvasToolbox.com</h3>
		<h2>Discussion</h2>
			<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>My partner and I first talked about the Art Kit domain and how it was very practical and straight to the point, and it conveyed what the website was about, which is reviewing art supplies. We talked about the Artist's Desk and how it was inviting and how it had personality. It feels more inviting because it's inviting the user into the space which works are created. Lastly, we talked about the Canvas Toolbox domain and how this is also very direct and informative to tools and how it's related to art. Overall we decided that all of these names did a good job of conveying the purpose of the website.</p>
			<h3>Verdict</h3>
				<p>We decided that the Artist's Desk name was the best name out of all of them because it was the most interesting and friendly, while also informing the user of the website's purpose. We also talked about how it's like inviting the user into a personal space rather than to just a forum. It's also less in your face and less to the point, while also making the point clear enough for the user to know what it's about. This name is also good because no matter what medium of art the user works on, they will most likey have a desk. This name is very universal in it's setting, but it's also very personal to the artist.</p>
